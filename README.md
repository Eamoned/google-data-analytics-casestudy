The case study centres on Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused smart products for women.

The business task is to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. Then select one Bellabeat product to apply these insights to and using this information, establish high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.

The analysis, insights gained and subsequent recommendations are based on the analysis of the FitBit Fitness Tracker dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit).
